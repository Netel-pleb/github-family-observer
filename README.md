# Project Documentation

## Overview

This project is designed to monitor the development progress of a repository by initializing the main repository and its family in a database, and continuously running a specified script at defined intervals. The project consists of several scripts that work together to achieve this goal.

## How to Run the Package

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bactensor/github-family-observer.git
   cd github-family-observer
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up the .env file**:
    ```sh
    GIT_ACCESS_TOKEN = "your git access token here"
    ```
4. **Prepare the config file**:
The script uses config.yaml file to get the configuration. Each run will store the current state of the repository in a SQLite database. Path to the database is specified in the config file. You can prepare your own config file or use the example one.

    ```
    # config.yaml
    DATABASE_DIR: "/path/to/your/db"
    MAIN_REPO: "your main repo owner/name"
    FORKS:
      - "your fork owner/name"
      - "your another fork owner/name"
    DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL: "your discord bot webhook url here"
    ```

5. **Run the Main Script**:
Run the script providing the config file and (optionally) wait interval between consecutive runs (in seconds).
    ```sh
    python main.py --interval 3600 config.yaml
    ```

## Target
The primary target of this project is to monitor the development progress of a repository by:

* Initializing the main repository and its family in a database.
* Continuously running a specified script to fetch and update the repository state.

## Main Principles

1. Initialization:

 * The main repository and its family are initialized in the database using the GitHub API.
 * The initial state of the repository is fetched and stored in the database.

2. Continuous Monitoring:

 * A specified script is run continuously at defined intervals to update the repository state.
 * The state data is processed to generate reports on branches and pull requests.

## Script Explanations

### `main.py`

This script initializes the main repository and repository family in the database and continuously runs a specified script at defined intervals.

* Functions:
    * run_bot(timestamp): Runs a specified Python script in a loop with a delay between executions.
* Usage:
    * Initializes the database by calling init_main_repo and init_repo_fam.
    * Runs the run.py script continuously with a delay specified by timestamp.

### `database.py`

This script initializes the database with the initial state of the main repository.

* Functions:
    * `init_main_repo()`: Initializes the main repository in the database.
    * `init_repo_fam()`: Initializes the repository family in the database.
    * `fetch_initial_state()`: Fetches the initial state from GitHub.
* Usage:
    * Run this script once to set up the initial state of the database.

* Functions:
    * `branch_report()`: Connects to the database, fetches the state data, and processes it to generate a report.
* Usage:
    * Run this script to generate a report on the current state of branches and pull requests.

## Conclusion

By following this documentation, you should be able to set up and run the project to monitor the development progress of a repository. Each script plays a crucial role in initializing the database, continuously updating the repository state, and generating reports.
